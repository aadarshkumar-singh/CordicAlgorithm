# CordicAlgorithm

Task : 1 
- SW- based reference implementation of the cordic algorithm was done in C because we wanted to make the implementation closer to the actual hardware, so that we are able to do decide on bit-width, number representations in HW. 

- To find the the number of iterations necessary we used python script, we analyzed by changing the number of iterations how the accuracy and precision were affected, we found greater the number of iterations, higher the precision.

Task -2 : 	ModelSim software was used for System Verilog Implementation and simulation of CORDIC system for rotation of angle.

Task -3 : 	ModelSim software was used for System Verilog Implementation and simulation of CORDIC based DDFS system for rotation of angle.
